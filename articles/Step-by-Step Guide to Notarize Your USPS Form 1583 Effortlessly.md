## What is USPS Form 1583?

The USPS Form 1583 is a critical document for authorizing a Commercial Mail Receiving Agency (CMRA) to accept mail on your behalf. With this form, you can rent a private or business mailing address in the U.S. and receive mail and packages with ease.

However, the notarization of Form 1583 is mandatory to validate the identity and signature on the document. For individuals in China or other foreign countries, this can be challenging since they cannot visit a U.S. notary in person. So, what’s the solution?

## How to Notarize Form 1583

### 1. Local Notary
In the U.S., the traditional way to notarize Form 1583 is to visit a local notary. Services are typically available at law firms, banks, or post offices. However, this option is not feasible for users in China or other foreign countries.

### 2. Online Notary
Online notarization platforms like [NotaryCam](https://notarycam.com) or [SafeDocs](https://safedocs.com) provide a modern alternative. Through video calls, users can communicate with a notary and complete the notarization remotely. The cost is around $75, and while this option is convenient, it usually requires English-language documents and instructions, which might not be ideal for users with limited English proficiency.

### 3. **Quick Notarization via Fiverr**
The best solution we recommend is using [Fiverr](https://bit.ly/FiVErr). This platform offers a wide selection of notaries who can notarize Form 1583, including some who provide services in Chinese. Simply search for "1583 notary," and you'll find a range of service providers, many of whom are well-rated and affordable. Prices start as low as $35, making Fiverr a more budget-friendly option compared to other online notary services.
