## What Does an Interior Designer Do?

Interior designers bring expertise and creativity to home projects, ensuring a balance of functionality and aesthetics. Their role involves:

- **Design Concepts:** Developing layouts, themes, and color palettes.  
- **Detailed Visuals:** Providing 3D renderings, technical drawings, or material lists.  
- **Product Selection:** Choosing surface finishes, lighting, furniture, cabinetry, and more.
