## 4. Drop-Servicing: Reselling Services You Donâ€™t Provide

If you donâ€™t have skills to sell, drop-servicing (or reselling services) can be a lucrative option. This involves acting as a middleman between clients and service providers on platforms like Fiverr. You create a service offering, find clients, and outsource the work to freelancers, earning a profit in the process.

**How It Works:**  
1. Set up an online agency.  
2. Find clients who need services like logo design or voice-overs.  
3. Locate freelancers on Fiverr offering these services at competitive prices.  
4. Connect the client to the freelancer and earn a commission.

**Quick Facts**  
- **Difficulty Level:** Easy.  
- **Risk:** You can lose your time.  
- **Best Case Profit:** Thereâ€™s no ceiling. Most gigs start from $20.

- **Risk:** You can lose your investment if BTC collapses.  
- **Best Case Profit:** ~30%/year.  
- **Initial Capital Needed:** ~$325.

**Quick Facts**  
- **Difficulty Level:** Moderate.  
- **Risk:** Short-term depreciation in crypto value.  
- **Best Case Profit:** >10% annually, depending on the pool and fees.

## 7. Affiliate Marketing: The Best Online Income Method

Affiliate marketing stands out as one of the best ways to generate online income. As an affiliate, you promote products or services to a specific audience using a unique referral link. For every sale generated through your link, you earn a commission.

### Why Affiliate Marketing Works:

- Vendors provide ready-made marketing materials.
- No handling of payments, delivery, or customer support.
- Advertising costs can be minimized with organic traffic.

**Quick Facts**
