## What is a Box Truck?

A box truck is a chassis cab truck with an enclosed rectangular cargo area, often ranging from 10 to 26 feet in length. These trucks, typically used for transporting furniture, packages, and bulk goods, are ideal for urban areas due to their maneuverability in tight spaces.

### What is a Box Truck Business?

A box truck business involves making money by delivering loads locally, often as part of the "less than truckload" (LTL) freight sector. With the growth of e-commerce, LTL deliveries have surged, making box trucks essential for small-scale, last-mile delivery.

## How Much Can You Earn?

The average annual income for box truck owner-operators is **$110,275**, translating to approximately **$53 per hour**. However, earnings can range from **$23,500 to $293,000**, depending on the volume of deliveries and how well costs are managed.

Startup costs include purchasing or leasing a box truck, which can range between **$25,000 and $45,000** for a new truck. Used trucks are a cheaper alternative, especially those with lower mileage.
